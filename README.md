<h1>HyperParameter-Tuning-with-Keras-Tuner-Fashion-MNIST-</h1>


<h1>About This Project</h1>
we will use Keras Tuner to find optimal hyperparamters for a Keras model. Keras Tuner is an open source package for Keras which can help machine learning practitioners automate Hyperparameter tuning tasks for their Keras models. The concepts learned in this project will apply across a variety of model architectures and problem scenarios. Please note that we are going to learn to use Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning, and are not going to implement the tuning algorithms ourselves. At the time of recording this project, Keras Tuner has a few tuning algorithms including Random Search, Bayesian Optimization and HyperBand. In order to complete this project successfully, you will need prior programming experience in Python. This is a practical, hands on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent but want to understand how to use Keras Tuner to start optimizing hyperparameters for training their Keras models. You should also be familiar with the Keras API..



Objectives of the course are:
Create Custom Tuners with Keras Tuner
Create Hyperparameter Tuning Experiments with Keras Tuner
using Fashion MNIST DATASET
